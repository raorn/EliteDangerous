# Combat Outfitting Guide by [/u/HoochCow](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoochCow) ([original reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eliteoutfitters/comments/74yzs0/fdl_setups_for_both_pvp_and_pve/))

The general rule of thumb here is that there is no difference between a good PvP build and a good PvE build beyond the fact you can get away with a shittier build in PvE.

These is more of a guide, but I promise some build ideas at the end. Please read the whole thing. I'll have to make multiple comments to myself in order to make the whole thing fit thanks to reditt's 10k character limit for replies and this being nearly 30k characters. We can throw builds at you all day and tell you this is good or this is bad. But honestly the best thing you can do here is LEARN so you'll know what's good and why its good. This will help you in building more than just FDLs but I've kinda focused this more or less around the FDL.

For starters lets begin with our baseline build of the core internals + explanations of the modifications and alternative 'good' modifications to help you make an informed choice in how to ultimately build your ship.

https://eddp.co/u/K6WwQvFf

## Core Internals
* **Reactive Surface Composite** + **G5 Thermal Resistance**: This gives you the same Hull Strength as **Military Grade Composite** but with better resistances, if you're not going to engineer this then buy **Military Grade Composite** since it offers the best all around stock resistances.
* **6A Power Plant**: This is left unengineered since we don't yet know the power constraints of our build. The rule of thumb here is though that if you don't have enough power then **G1 Overcharged** hitting random for your stats to simulate an engineer roll and increasing the grade of the roll by one until you either consistently get enough power rolling randomly or hit **G5**. You never want a **G5 Overcharged** roll unless you have no other choice since your ship will run hot as fuck.
> If you have way too much power stock after you're done outfitting then either leave it alone, or consider **Low Emissions**. this will make your ship run cooler but your powerplant will output less power meaning if you plan on micromanaging your power priorities you may not be able to keep essential systems (Engines, FSD, Sensors) at the under 40% power mark so you don't go offline when your powerplant is shot to zero but not destroyed. This is best for if you're an explorer build or running really hot weapons and somehow have left over power. The other downside is this increases your ships mass a little which might negatively impact your speed a little.
* **5A Thrusters** + **Dirty Drives**: **Dirty Drives** are objectively the best choice for combat builds since they will increase your top speed, boost speed, and agility. Their only drawback is that they reduce your optimal mass. As your ships weight goes above optimal mass you start to loose performance, as it goes under it you gain performance. Generally though even above optimal mass **Dirty Drives** will make you faster than stock drives.
* **4A Frame Shift Drive** + **G5 Increased Range**: **Increased Range** does exactly what it says on the tin. You can jump further at the cost of slightly increased fuel usage per jump. There is absolutely NO reason not to take this... unless.
> **G5 Faster Boot Sequence**: this will not negatively impact your jump range nor will it increase it. What it does is make your FSD boot up faster after its been powered down meaning if you have to set your FSD to a lower power priority and it gets shut off when hardpoints are deployed it will boot back up faster when hard points are retracted allowing you jump out of the instance sooner. This is nice, but honestly if you learn to pick your fights well and manage your power correctly you will almost never find a reason to use this mod over **Increased Range**.
* **4D Life Support** + **G4 Lightweight**: This gives you the absolute lightest life support you can carry. There is ZERO reason to engineer for anything other than **Lightweight**, and Zero reason to choose a life support higher than 4D unless it literally almost always takes you more than 7 minutes 30 seconds to get out of an instance, supercruise to a station or settlement and get repairs which will almost never be the case. The lightweight mod isn't exactly a requirement here, but its worth getting as it keeps your ships mass down letting you jump further and fly faster.
* **6A Power Distributor** + **G5 Charge Enhanced**: The only reason to not have the highest **PD** you can buy is if you're an explorer which you're not seeing as you're building an FDL. Your shields weapons and engines hold better and recharge faster. **G5 Charge Enhanced** reduces the power each of the three major subsystems get, but greatly improves their recharge rate meaning everything just comes back faster for you. It is the ONLY engineer modification you should EVER put on a **Power Distributor** with only one exception of **Engine Focused** for underpowered PDs for explorer ships.
* **4D Sensors** + **G5 Long Range**: This allows you to have lighter mass & better range than stock A rated sensors.
> Alternatively you could grab **4A** + **G5 Lightweight** while you won't get the Range of **4D** + **G5 Long Range** you'll still have a high sensor range with even less weight than 4D sensors, but only grab this if you have power to spare after you're done picking the rest of your outfitting options and really want it.
* **3C Fuel Tank**: Leave this alone, you can't engineer it and while reducing it by one size lets you jump like 0.2ly further your range per tank is slashed in half. There is NO reason to change this unless you're making an ultralight racing ship which you're not.

## Optional Internals
Now that you have an idea of core internals lets look into Optional Internals there are really only a few good choices here and we will go into each one.

### Shield Generator
* **5A Prismatic Shield Generator**: Hands down the most powerful shield in the game. It takes longer to recharge after absorbing damage, and even longer to recharge from broken. Plus you gotta do Powerplay to unlock it ~vomits at the thought of powerplay~ However if you're going to do powerplay to unlock Power modules this is objectively the best one to unlock hands down.
* **5C Bi-Weave Shield Generator**: The weakest of the the three shield options, but your shields recharge rates are effectively slashed in half vs other shield types and they are the least power hungry so its a very fair trade off and makes the Bi-Weaves arguably better than default **5A** shields.
* **5A Shield Generator**: A middle ground across the board between **Prismatic** and **Bi-Weaves**. Nothing special.

#### Shield Modifications
* **Enhanced Low Power**: Slightly increases shield strength output, reduces mass so you can fly faster and jump further and increases shield regen rates for broken shields. Generally not worth it for combat builds, absolutely worth it for exploration builds.
* **Reinforced**: Improves Resistances across the board, raises your overall shield strength, makes your shields recharge slower.
* **Thermal Resistance**: Arguably the best choice, while it doesn't raise your overall shield strength it alters your shields resistances. You'll loose about 5-15% kinetic resistance but gain up to 15-70% Thermal Resistance which means your shields get more out of each MJ of energy. It also increases the modules integrity meaning it can take more punishment! Make sure you get a **GOOD** roll on this!

### FUEL SCOOP
* **4A** or **2A**. If you plan to travel a lot in your FDL you're going to want a **Fuel Scoop**. the **4A** will refuel you in around 30-40 seconds from empty at max scoop rate, where as the **2A** will take longer than 2 or 3 minutes to refuel you from empty since you can't spend long enough that close to a star to keep max scoop rate going without overheating. If you got the patience to do a **2A** then its objectively the better choice for a combat build, but lets face facts here, you probably don't and will buy **4A** and frankly nobody will blame you.

### CARGO RACKS
Are you going to run missions in this FDL? If the answer is no don't buy one. If the Answer is yes decide if you need a **4E** for 16 tons or grab a Class 2 and/or Class 1 rack.
> If you plan on doing shit with thargoid samples & hearts using then grab one or two **F** rated **Corrosion Resistant Racks** in your Class 1 & 2 slots slots

### Collector Limpets
* **Research Limpet**: **ONLY GET THIS FOR THARGOID CONTENT**, with the limited space in the FDL for Optional internals you're honestly better off picking a different ship for giving the goids a biopsy, and you'll absolutely need cargo racks to carry the limpets.
* **Collector Limpets**: Again not really worth it on the FDL due to its limited internal space and the fact you'll also need a cargo rack, but if you plan on picking up shit from destroyed Thargoids or collecting engineer mats from destroyed ships these save you time, but again you'll need a cargo rack to carry your limpets and are better off using a different ship for this.

### FSD Interdictor
Grab a **1A** or a **2A** for your FDL ONLY if you plan on pulling people out of Supercruise for PVP, interdicting ships for missions, or pulling out NPCs that are valuable targets.

### FSD Interdictor Mods
* G4 Expanded Capture Arc: Objectively the best mod and only one you should consider worth your while. This means you can interdict targets from sharper angles making it easier to initiate interdiction.

### Planetary Vehicle Hangar
Not worth it unless you're doing missions, if you get one get a **2G Hangar**, there is no reason to have a bigger hangar unless you're exploring or doing a lot of base assault missions.

### Shield Cell Banks
These are a god send in a tight spot when you need to keep those shields online especially if you're a poor mofo flying with a **Lightweight** hull that will get melted by larger ships in combat. Primarily you only really want this if you're running a shield tank build or a balanced build and have the space to spare for one. Generally you want a **SCB** that can recharge about 20% or more of your total shields when popped. However be aware these things produce a stupid amount of heat and will damage internals if you don't pop a heat sink with them, and they have a spool up time meaning your shields can still go offline and have you expend the **SCB** for nothing, and they are worthless when your shields are offline. If you grab one only grab an A rated one or B rated one. A rated recharges the most, but B rated gives you an extra **SCB** and means across all of your **SCBs** you can recharge a greater total of MJ of shields. Just consider though that unless you're running a shield tank build you really won't need **SCBs** that much and they should be added if you have the room and power for them. At the very least its nice to have at least one on any ship that will see combat if you can spare the power for it. Frankly both of the available mods for this module are good and its up to personal preference in my opinion as to which you take.
* **G3 Rapid Charge**: You'll get a little less reinforcement from your **SCBs** in exchange for a faster time overall time to pop one and get your shields buffed back up.
* **G3 Specialized**: These spool up to start the reinforcement process sooner, but take as long as a standard no mod bank to pump more energy back into your shields, they also generate less heat, however they draw more power.

### Module Reinforcement Package
Grab one or two of these in your smallest slots they make your modules hard to shoot out. However keep in mind you should **ONLY** get these if you're flying a ship that can take enough of a beat to not pop before its modules can be shot fully out. Otherwise its useless.

### Hull Reinforcement Package
These are your bread and butter when shields pop especially if you're using **Reactive Surface Bulkheads** with **G5 Thermal Resist** mod. Grab these and slap **G5 Heavy Duty** mods on them! each one will raise your damage resistances across the board by approximately 15% give or take a percent or two depending on the size of the module as well as increase the overall hull integrity they add to your ship. Their only drawback is they add mass to your ship which will negatively impact your speed jump range and turn rate. A good target to aim for is getting about 30%-50% bonus to your resistances across the board for your hull which you can achieve with 2-4 of these with good **G5 Heavy Duty** rolls

### Docking Computer
* ~~LEARN TO FLY NOOB!~~
* ~~If you can't land your ship you shouldn't be doing combat!~~
* ~~GIT GUD SCRUB!...~~
Seriously its only worth it if you're a trader and lazy, you're not a trader and there is no place for lazy in combat so don't use it.

### Advanced Discovery Scanner
You're not an explorer, just drop in on the nav beacon and scan that or buy the system data on the gal map if available should you run into a system where the planets & stations aren't fully revealed yet.

## Hardpoints

With Optional Internals out of the way lets delve into Hardpoints

Hardpoints are broken into these categories.
* **Thermal**: Pulse, Burst, Beam Lasers, & Mining Lasers
* **Kinetic**: Multi-Cannons, Cannons, Frag Cannons
* **Thermic-Kinetic**: Rail Guns & Plasma Accelerators
* **Explosives**: Missiles, Seeker Missiles, Torpedoes, & Mine Launchers

### Thermal
* **Pulse**: Arguably the best laser to use. While it does the least amount of damage it also uses the least amount of distributor draw meaning throughout the whole fight you can fire more and have a higher Sustained DPS (Sustained DPS is your total DPS output before the distributor is drained)
* **Burst**: A balance between Pulse & Beam
* **Beam**: This has the highest Burst DPS and the highest Distributor Draw meaning your lasers will be down more than a pulse or burst to recharge before you can fire again. (Burst DPS is how much damage you can put out per second)
* **Mining**: Mostly Harmless

#### Engineer Mods for Lasers
* **Long Range**: The best one to take! Long Range doesn't raise your lasers damage, but it negates the damage falloff on lasers which means you exponentially deal less damage after 600m. It can raise this up to 6km range with no drop offs.
* **Efficient**: Lasers do a little more damage, but the damage fall off stays at 600meters, but lasers eat up less distributor power. ONLY take this when you just can't sustain fire for a reasonable length of time.

#### Experimental Effects for Lasers
* **NO EFFECT**: Generally best for Pulse & Burst overall as most of the good effects for these lasers come with shitty drawbacks
* **Scramble Spectrum** (Burst & Pulse Only): You should have this on one of your lasers if possible as strikes to the hull have a chance of causing a random malfunction to your targets module with about a 10 second cool down before another malfunction can happen. Can be damn annoying for your target on the off chance their thrusters or powerplant shit the bed for a few seconds. However this mod also reduces damage hence why only take it on one or at most two of your lasers.
* **Phasing Sequence** (Burst & Pulse Only): You loose 10% damage but you get some shield bleed through damage meaning some of your damage phases through the shield to hurt their hull. Its really a situational mod and useful vs shield tanks with weak hulls but overall not worth it
* **Emissive Munitions** (Pulse Only) Increases the heat output of the laser, but lights your target up like a christmas tree by amplifying their heat signature, very niche and only good vs silent running ships, if you're using this only have it on one laser to minimize your heat gain.
* **Thermal Shock** (All Lasers): Reduces your damage, but imparts heat to the target which can build up and cause module damage if it makes them overheat. Only worth it if you can impart enough heat into the target and keep them overheated enough to have rapid module damage, otherwise give it a skip as this is an all or nothing effect that is nothing but a drawback if its not on everything.
* **Thermal Vent** (Beam Only): Only grab this if you're not a shit shot, otherwise your beams are best with no effect. When hitting your target you expel excess heat in your ship but gain more heat if you miss.

### Kinetic
Preface here: while quad medium kinetic weapons can be beastly on this ship you need to consider this. When fighting larger vessels you're going to be less effective with smaller weapons, so a number of pvp experts I've talked to recommend putting your kinetic weapon on the huge hard point of the FDL
* **Multi-Cannon**: This is your go to gun for that sweet hull shredding daka daka action! Low Distributor Draw, rapid fire, high projectile speed, low damage per shot, high dps.
* **Cannon**: These are alright vs larger ships and when jousting, but generally useless vs small fast ships as you'll just miss a lot even with gimbals. Low Distributor Draw, slow Fire Rate, moderate projectile speed, high damage per shot, low dps.
* **Frag Cannon**: These can be absolutely devastating if used properly, but their range is so low you gotta be close enough to your target to smell their farts when they start shitting their pants! Low distributor Draw, Moderate fire rate, low projectile speed, moderate damage per shot, moderate-high dps, shit range.

#### Multi-Cannon Mods
* **Overcharged**: This is your best choice, the added distributor draw doesn't matter much since multis already have a low drain, and gives you a great damage buff!
* **Rapid Fire**: Your DPS goes up a lot, but you have less ammo and introduce some jitter to your aim which kinda sucks and can cause shots to not be on point.

#### Cannon Mods
* **Overcharged**: More damage, blah blah you know this already good choice.
* **Long Range**: Raises range and shot speed which is great since cannon shells are sloooooooooow

#### Frag Cannon Mods
* **Double Shot**: Higher Mag Size, reduced range, gives great Burst DPS potential with minimal drawbacks
* **Overcharged**: Covered it twice now.
* **Rapid Fire**: You'll eat through ammo but it can greatly improve your DPS in a fight!

#### Good Kinetic Engineer Effects
* **Auto-Loader** (Multi-cannon & Cannon Only): Reloads as you fire best for multi-cannons and better than nothing for cannons, a great choice if you use a lot of multis!
* **Corrosive Shell** (Multi & Frag Only): Fucks your targets hull up so all your damage does more damage! Seriously the best damn effect in the world as far as I'm concerned.
* **Incendiary Rounds** (Multi & Frag Only): Converts a portion of your Kinetic Damage to Thermal making you more effective vs shields but less effective vs hulls. Great if you're running an all Kinetic Build, otherwise pass.
* **Dispersal Field** (Cannons Only): Acts like Chaff confusing their gimbals and turrets.
* **High Yield Shell** (Cannons Only): Fuck their modules a new asshole! Need more be said?... okay you loose a little base damage for this, but whats that matter if you can score successive hits on their power plant?
* **Drag Munitions** (Frag Only): Takes away their ability to distribute power to their engines slowing them down and making them less agile.
* **Screening Shell** (Frag Only): Better Reload Times and bonus effectiveness vs munitions for attempting to shoot missiles down!

### Thermic-Kinetic Weapons
* **Plasma Accelerator**: Highest Per Shot Damage in the game, generates a fuck ton of heat, slow to reload, and slow projectile speed. ONLY comes in Fixed and Class 2 or higher Hardpoints Only.
* **Rail Guns**: High speed projectile that deals high per shot damage, fucks modules upon impact, but has a slow shot speed where a charge up happens when you pull the trigger before the round actually fires, however once it fires its basically as accurate as a laser since it moves to fast to be dodged without breaking the laws of physics. Fixed Only. Class 1 & 2 Hardpoints Only.

#### Plasma Mods
* **Efficient**: Raises Damage, Lowers Thermal Load, Lowers Distributor Draw, you can not go wrong!
* **Overcharged**: Raises Damage by a fuck ton, but your distributor is going to start crying and your ship will roast like a thanksgiving turkey! If you put this on all your PAs you will probably do more damage to yourself than your enemy!
* **Focused**: Better Shot Speed, Range, & Rate of Fire, Reduced Damage Falloff + more penetration because those modules need a good dicking.
* **Long Range**: Better Shot Speed, Stupid Good Range, No Damage Falloff!

#### Plasma Effects
* **Target Lock Breaker**: Enemy loses target lock on you, very annoying for them!
* **Dispersal Field**: Acts like Chaff on hit!
* **Dazzle Shell**: Reduces targets sensor acuity which makes it so if your ship is running cool they will have a hard time tracking you on their radar
* **Phasing Sequence**: Only worth it if you're running an all or mostly plasma build as it bleeds some damage through shields at the cost of reduced overall damage. Great vs shield tanks with weak hulls, but there are better options.

#### Railgun Mods
* **Long Range**: Seriously this is the best option, fuck everything else. Range is increased and you lose all your damage drop off allowing you to always get the maximum effect of your experimental effects.

#### Railgun Effects
* **Feedback Cascade**: While it reduces your Railgun damage by a considerable amount it also reduces the effectiveness of an enemies shield cell banks when you strike their shields while a **SCB** is spooling up which you can spot by the blue lines washing over the shield bubble. A couple of good hits hits can effectively knock out their shields completely or at least negate most if not all of their **SCBs** recharge energy. Very situational but very worth it when you can use it.
* **Super Penetrator**: This tears through enemy modules. Direct hits to modules on ships without a Module Reinforcement Package can actually knock those modules out in a couple shots, however your reload time is increased by 50% So you're gonna have to git gud to make the most of this.

### Explosives
* **Dumbfire Missiles**: Mostly Garbage, fires in a straight line
* **Seeker Missiles**: Mostly Garbage, must lock onto target, can be used by a gunner in multicrew to fire in almost any direction
* **Torpedoes**: Actually useful with the right mods & effects but you're out of ammo after 3 shots.
* **Mine Launchers**: Go home, you're drunk
> Missiles used to be godly but they received a nerf sometime around v 1.0 or v1.1 of the game, and while they have been slightly improved they are nowhere near the god weapons they used to be. However they are great at fucking modules, but totally useless when shields are up for the most part.

#### Dumbfire & Seeker Missile Mods
* **High Capacity Magazine**: This is the only mod worth a damn for missiles, you get more missiles at the cost of your reload taking 2-5 seconds longer.

#### Dumbfire Effects
* **Penetrator Munitions**: Does more damage to modules, basically its the only dumbfire mod worth a damn... unless youre a pirate or ganker
* **FSD Interrupt**: This is a ganker weapon more or less, It resets your enemies FSD forcing it to reboot but you suffer reduced damage. So its more or less useless unless you're a pirate or ganker.

#### Seeker Effects
* **Drag Munitions**: Basically only seeker effect worth a fuck, it does the same thing as the frag cannon effect. Fucks with your targets power to their engines.

#### Torpedo Mods
* **Sturdy**: More penetration, need more be said, okay your thermal load and mass goes up with this, but if you're using explosives you probably don't give a fuck anyway so who cares if it makes your ship heavier.

#### Torpedo Effects
* **Penetrator Munitions**: Torpedoes already have crazy good penetration for fucking up modules, this makes them almost 50% better at it.
* **Reverberating Cascade**: Land a few hits with this and you just fucked their shield generator a new asshole as in it will be offline. Its the best effect, but mostly only used for ganking single targets.

#### Mine Launcher Mods
* **High Capacity Magazine**: More Mines, only one worth having.

#### Mine Launcher Effects
* **Ion Disruptor**: Resets your targets drives, but be warned you can hit yourself with your own mines.
* **Reverberating Cascade**: Same as the torpedoes, fucks up shields, but its a mine so you can hit yourself so be careful!

## Utilities
**HOLY SHIT WERE ALMOST DONE!**

Utility Slots, these are a necessity and depending upon your build & ship you'll be using different ones.

### Shield Booster
This is your bread and butter utility. Makes your shields suck less. There are two mods worth a fuck for these.
* **G5 Heavy Duty**: Gives your **MORE** shields without impacting your shield recharge rates... however because you have more shields your recharge rate will go up anyway.
* **G5 Resistance Augmented**: Adds 12.5% resistance across the board to Explosive, Thermal, & Kinetic Damage without changing the base amount of extra shield strength the boosters give you. Combined with **G5 Thermal** on the **Shield Generator** you can easily work up to 80-100% resistance giving you more bang per MJ of shield energy. My general rule of thumb is to try and get a 50-80% increase to all resistances through these then drop on **Heavy Duty** for your remaining boosters.

### Heat Sink Launchers
These are way more useful than people give them credit for. Beyond keeping your ship cool when you have a fuel scooping accident, they can keep you from overheating when you pop a **Shield Cell Booster**, they also will make your ship cooler which raises the efficiency of your laser weapons for a few short seconds letting you shoot them a little bit longer, and they keep your silent running builds from overheating. If you're running with **SCBs** then you should have one of these for each SCB module you have installed, if you're doing a silent running build then you need a lot of these! There is only one mod worth getting for them.
* **G3 High Capacity Magazine**: Gives you +1 ammo to the Heat Sink Launcher

### Chaff Launcher
Every Combat Ship that is small or medium should consider having at least one or two of these on board. They fuck with gimbals and turrets so they can't get a bead on you. There is only one good engineer mod for these.
* **G3 High Capacity Magazine**: This can add +2 to +5 more chaff ammo to your launcher

### Point Defense
Shoots down Missiles for you, and also shoots at incoming hatch breaker limpets although fuck me if I can remember if they actually hurt hatch breakers anymore FDev keeps changing that shit and I can't keep track of it.
* **G5 Lightweight**: You'll never run out of ammo for these or have them shot out unless you're the unluckiest motherfucker in the game. So might as well reduce their mass.

### Electronic Countermeasures
This is an activated utility that sends out a pulse around your ship with the range of the pulse getting bigger the longer you hold in the trigger for it. This basically sends a kill switch signal to missiles in its range.
* **G5 Lightweight** is the only mod worth grabbing for this.

###Specialty Scanners
* **Manifest Scanner**: YOU ARE A PIRATE! See whats in their hold
* **Kill Warrant Scanner**: Find out if your target is wanted in other systems giving you more money per bounty kill!
* **Frame Shift Wake Scanner**: YOU ARE A PIRATE... or ganker. If your target jumps away scan their wake to find out where they went and follow them. Honestly you'll only ever equip this when you gotta get wake data for engineers.
You either want to **D** rate these and then slowly raise them up by one rating until you **A** rate them or run out of power for them should you use them... with the exception of the wake scanner, always **D** rate that shit. The higher their rating the more power they use but also the farther away you can scan from.
* **G5 Fast Scan**: Reduces your scan range, but makes the scans REALLY fast. (Recommended for Manifest Scanner, only for Kill Warrant if you can get it up to at bare minimum a C rating)
* **G5 Long Range**: Doesn't change scan time, but lets you scan from farther away, (Use this for Wake Scanner and Kill Warrant Scanners you can't get to a C or B rating)

## Examples
OKAY WHEW that was a hell of a read wasn't it? Hope you learned some shit. Now heres a few builds for you, can't promise they are all good, but just examples of possibilities. feel free to tweak them as you see fit to suit your needs or use what you learned here to build your ship your own way. If you have any questions, please ask.
